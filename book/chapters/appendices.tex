\chapter{Glossary}\label{app:glossary}
% ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

\begin{description}[style=nextline, leftmargin=2.5cm, labelwidth=2.3cm, itemsep=6pt]

\item[Absorbing state]
A state of the product automaton from which no accepting state is
reachable.  Once entered, no continuation can produce a grammar-valid
sequence.

\item[Blast radius]
The number of downstream labels or decisions invalidated by a single
pivot shift.

\item[Candidate pool]
The set of events involving the focal actor that are available for
inclusion in the narrative arc.

\item[Commit-now policy]
A streaming policy that irrevocably assigns phase labels to each event
as it arrives, based on the current running-max pivot.

\item[Committed semantics]
The interpretation regime under which the pivot identity is locked and
cannot be revised by future events.

\item[Compression contract]
A pre/post condition pair that a compression map must satisfy to
guarantee that the pivot is preserved and the context does not enter the
absorbing ideal.

\item[Context element]
A triple $(\wstar, \dtotal, \dpre)$ that summarises the structural
state of a contiguous block of events: the best pivot weight, the total
development capacity, and the pre-pivot development capacity.

\item[Deferred commitment]
A streaming policy that withholds label assignment for the first
fraction~$f$ of the sequence, committing only after the pivot has
stabilised.

\item[Development-eligible]
An event is development-eligible if it is a non-focal event whose
timestamp precedes the current pivot.  Such events can serve as
\textsc{development} beats in the phase grammar.

\item[Endogenous pivot]
A distinguished element of the output that is selected by argmax over
the output itself, creating a circular dependency between selection and
interpretation.

\item[Enumerative solver]
A solver that iterates over the top-$M$ pivot candidates by weight,
attempting grammar-valid extraction for each, and returns the first
success.

\item[Event graph]
The directed graph $G = (V, E, t, w, a)$ encoding all events in the
simulation, with timestamps, weights, and actor assignments.

\item[Feasibility]
A sequence is feasible if it satisfies the phase grammar with at least
$k$ development beats before the turning point selected by the
endogenous pivot function.

\item[Fixed-pivot feasibility (FPF)]
The fraction of compressed sequences that remain grammar-valid when
evaluated against the pre-compression pivot.

\item[Focal actor]
The agent $a^{\star}$ whose narrative arc is being extracted from the
event graph.

\item[Grammar-aware classifier]
A classifier that uses the phase grammar's state to prune or reweight
events during arc extraction, treating the grammar as a regulariser
rather than a post-hoc validator.

\item[Mirage gap]
The quantitative difference between raw validity (which may be $1.0$)
and pivot-preserving metrics such as FPF or PPR.  A large mirage gap
indicates that standard metrics are hiding semantic failures.

\item[Monotonic DFA]
A DFA whose state transitions are monotonically ordered: once a phase
is exited, it cannot be re-entered.

\item[Oscillation trap]
A streaming state in which the running-max pivot has overtaken the
committed pivot, leaving the policy in an absorbing state from which
no grammar-valid continuation exists.

\item[Patience parameter]
The fraction $f \in [0, 1]$ of the sequence that the deferred
commitment policy processes before locking the pivot.

\item[Phase grammar]
A deterministic finite automaton that specifies the legal ordering of
narrative phases: \textsc{setup}, \textsc{development},
\textsc{turning\_point}, \textsc{resolution}.

\item[Pivot preservation (PPR)]
The fraction of sequences in which the post-operation pivot (after
compression, streaming, or other transformation) matches the
pre-operation pivot.

\item[Prefix requirement]
The parameter $k$ specifying the minimum number of \textsc{development}
beats that must precede the turning point for a sequence to be
grammar-valid.

\item[Record process]
The stochastic process formed by the running maximum of pivot weights
in a stream.  Each new record corresponds to a pivot update.

\item[Semantic regret]
The quality loss caused by a pivot shift: the difference in composite
$Q$-score between the arc built around the original pivot and the arc
built around the shifted pivot.

\item[Tropical context]
A pair $(W, \dtotal)$ where $W$ is a weight vector indexed by pre-pivot
development count.  The tropical composition rule is a shift-and-max
operation derived from the tropical semiring.

\item[Turning point]
The event selected by the endogenous pivot function---the single
highest-weight focal event in the chosen subsequence.

\item[Validity mirage]
The phenomenon in which standard validity metrics (grammar satisfaction,
constraint checks) report perfect scores while the semantic content of
the output has been silently corrupted by a pivot shift.

\item[Weight vector]
The vector $W[0..k]$ in a tropical context, where $W[j]$ is the best
pivot weight achievable with exactly $j$ pre-pivot development events.

\chapter{Determinism Contract}\label{app:determinism}
% ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Every experimental result in this book is deterministically
reproducible.  This appendix documents the mechanisms that guarantee
reproducibility.

\section{Fixed Random Seeds}\label{sec:det-seeds}

Every random generator in the codebase takes an explicit seed parameter.
No experiment relies on a global random state or on the default seed.
Each test function creates its own \texttt{numpy.random.Generator}
instance initialised with a fixed seed, ensuring that the random state
of one test cannot contaminate another.

\begin{verbatim}
rng = numpy.random.default_rng(seed=42)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
The seed value is recorded in the test file and in the output CSV.
Re-running the test with the same seed on the same platform produces
bit-identical results.

\section{Deterministic Tie-Breaking}\label{sec:det-tiebreak}

When two events have equal weight, the system breaks ties using a
three-key tuple:
\[
  (\,w,\;\; {-t},\;\; \texttt{event\_id}\,),
\]
where $w$ is the event weight, $t$ is the timestamp (negated so that
earlier events win ties), and \texttt{event\_id} is a unique integer
identifier assigned at event creation.  This ensures a strict total
order on events, eliminating any dependence on hash randomisation or
memory layout.

\section{Stable Sorting}\label{sec:det-sorting}

All sorting operations use a stable sort with an explicit key function.
No code path relies on the default comparison of complex objects or on
the stability guarantees of a particular sorting algorithm beyond the
Python specification that \texttt{list.sort()} and \texttt{sorted()} are
stable.  Where numpy sorting is used, \texttt{kind='stable'} is
specified explicitly.

\section{Isolated Random State}\label{sec:det-isolation}

Each test creates its own \texttt{numpy.random.Generator} with a fixed
seed.  Tests do not share random state, and the order in which tests
are executed does not affect their outputs.  This isolation is
enforced by convention: no test reads from or writes to a global
random state.

\section{Platform Independence}\label{sec:det-platform}

All results reported in this book were produced and verified on the
following platform:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
  \item Python~3.14
  \item NumPy (current stable release)
  \item macOS (Darwin)
\end{itemize}
No platform-specific numerical libraries (e.g., MKL, CUDA) are used
in the core experimental pipeline.  Floating-point operations follow
IEEE~754 double-precision semantics.  No experiment depends on
nondeterministic GPU operations.

book to the test file that produces it, the CSV artifact that records
