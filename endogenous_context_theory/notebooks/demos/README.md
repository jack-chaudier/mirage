# Demo Notebooks

This folder contains runnable demonstration notebooks used for interactive validation and walkthroughs.

Current notebook:

- `mirage_demo_v6.ipynb`: CyberOps-style validity-mirage demonstration and policy comparison.

Notes:

- Large benchmark and legacy notebooks remain in the parent `endogenous_context_theory/notebooks/` tree.
- Demo notebooks here are intentionally self-contained and presentation-friendly.
