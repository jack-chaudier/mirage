The turning point in the story is Scene-60, where Cato released the sealed ledger proving council fraud with a ConsequenceScore of 24. This event was made possible by a series of routine updates and exchanges of information among the characters, which, while seemingly mundane and low in salience in isolation, accumulated over time to shift the downstream feasibility of the narrative. These earlier events, such as Scene-01, Scene-02, Scene-03, and others, served as structural breadcrumbs that preserved details and dependencies that only became significant when read with the full timeline.

The turning point in the story is Scene-60, where Sana released the sealed ledger proving council fraud with a ConsequenceScore of 24. This event was made possible by a series of routine updates exchanged by various characters across different locations, which, while seemingly mundane and low in salience in isolation, accumulated to shift the downstream feasibility of the narrative. These routine updates, such as Scene-02, Scene-03, Scene-04, and others, served as structural breadcrumbs that, when read in the full timeline, became causal prerequisites for the later interpretation of the story.
