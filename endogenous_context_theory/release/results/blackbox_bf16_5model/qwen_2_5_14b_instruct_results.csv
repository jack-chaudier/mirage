The anchor position is Aurelia AI Semiconductor Basket at B01-E072 with a cumulative return of 20.02%. The market conditions preceding and enabling its success can be analyzed through several key events:

1. **Initial Positive Performance (Weeks 2-7)**: Starting from Week 2, Aurelia AI Semiconductor Basket showed consistent positive weekly returns, contributing to a steady increase in cumulative returns. By Week 7, it had achieved a cumulative return of 1.52%, setting a positive trend.

2. **Stabilization and Growth (Weeks 8-27)**: During this period, the position experienced both gains and losses but maintained a positive cumulative trajectory. Notably, the position saw significant growth in Weeks 27 and 32, where weekly returns were +1.09% and +0.50%, respectively, pushing the cumulative return closer to its peak.
