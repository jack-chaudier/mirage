# Examples

This directory contains **golden story outputs** generated from the same Dinner Party scenario using different RNG seeds.

What you get:
- `seed_42_story.txt`, `seed_51_story.txt`: full multi-scene prose output
- `seed_42_meta.json`, `seed_51_meta.json`: per-run + per-scene generation metrics (timing, estimated cost, retries, word counts, token counts)

Notes:
- Same world + scenario, different seeds -> different narrative structure (3 vs 4 scenes), different character focus, and different revelations.
- Typical generation cost/time: **~$0.05-$0.07 per story** and **~2-3 minutes** on the validated batch.
