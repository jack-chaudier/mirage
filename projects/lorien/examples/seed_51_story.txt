The table was set with the kind of careful precision that made Diana nervous. Charger plates, water glasses, napkins folded into triangles. Everything arranged to suggest control, to suggest that the evening would unfold as planned. She knew better.

Thorne sat at the head of the table, one hand wrapped around a wine glass, the other gesturing as he spoke about a merger that had closed that afternoon. His voice had that particular timbre it took on when he was pleased with himself—measured, confident, the voice of a man accustomed to being listened to.

"They didn't think we had the numbers," he was saying. "But we did. Always do."

Elena smiled from across the table. The smile didn't reach her eyes. Diana noticed this the way she noticed everything about Elena now—the small fractures in her composure, the way her fingers pressed too firmly against the stem of her wine glass. Guilt made you observant. Guilt made you watchful.

Victor sat to Diana's left, cutting into his salmon with the kind of focused attention he usually reserved for people he was interviewing. He was the sort of man who listened to you with his whole body angled toward you, and it was only afterward that you realized he'd extracted more than you'd meant to give.

"Congratulations," Victor said, not looking up. "That's the Hendricks account?"

Thorne's expression flickered. "You've been following it?"

"I follow most things." Victor finally glanced up. There was something sharp in his gaze, something that made Diana's chest tighten. She'd known Victor since university. She'd never quite gotten used to that look. "Interesting timing, actually. I was reading about some of the firms in that consortium. One of them had some accounting irregularities last year."

The pause that followed was small enough that no one else might have noticed it. Diana felt it like a held breath.

Marcus, sitting between Elena and Lydia, reached for his water glass. His hand was steady, but there was a tightness around his mouth that hadn't been there a moment before.

"That was resolved," Marcus said. "Audit cleared them completely."

"After several months," Victor said. He was doing that thing now—the pressing thing. Diana could see it happening in real time, the journalist in him waking up, scenting blood in the water. "Interesting how these things get resolved. Usually there are people involved. People who know things."

Lydia's fork clattered softly against her plate. Diana watched her set it down with exaggerated care, as though a sudden movement might shatter the room. Lydia was the kind of person who felt other people's danger the way animals felt storms.

Elena took a long drink of wine.

"Victor," Diana said, hearing the stiffness in her own voice, "tell us about your piece. The one you mentioned earlier."

It was a transparent deflection. Everyone knew it was transparent. Victor smiled slightly, as though Diana had just confirmed something he'd suspected.

"Which one?" he asked. He was still looking at Marcus. "I'm working on several."

"The one about the foundation," Diana pressed.

"Right. That one's interesting." Victor turned to her then, finally, and the gentleness in his expression was somehow worse than the sharpness had been. It was the gentleness of someone who'd already decided how the story would end. "It's about how money moves through places it shouldn't. How good people sometimes help it move, because they owe someone. Because they're scared. Because they've already compromised themselves once and think they might as well keep going."

Diana felt her throat close.

Thorne set down his glass. The clink of crystal against wood seemed to echo.

"Are you making an accusation, Victor, or just making conversation?"

* * *

Victor's hand stilled. He set his knife against the rim of his plate with deliberate care, the clink precise enough to draw every eye. When he looked up, his face had settled into something neither aggressive nor defensive—the blank attention of someone who'd asked a question worth repeating.

"Conversation," he said. "So far."

Diana felt the word land like a pebble in still water. She watched Thorne's jaw tighten, watched the small muscle along his temple pulse once, twice. His wine glass was halfway to his mouth. He didn't drink from it.

Elena's breathing had changed. Diana noticed this the way she'd learned to notice such things over the years—a shallowing, a precision to it that suggested conscious control. Elena was very still, her fork resting across the edge of her plate at an angle that made her look like she'd simply paused mid-thought. Only her eyes moved, finding Marcus, then finding her water glass, then finding the middle distance above the table where nothing demanded anything of her.

"Conversation," Thorne repeated. He smiled without warmth. "Then perhaps we should clarify what you're conversing about. Because it sounds to me like you're suggesting someone at this table—" he gestured lightly with the wine glass, "—someone at this specific table, helped money move where it shouldn't have moved. That someone was driven by debt or fear or prior compromise. Is that the conversation we're having?"

Diana's chest tightened. She could feel the rhythm of the evening shifting, the careful choreography dissolving. She'd known when Victor mentioned the piece on financial irregularities that he'd read the room wrong—or read it exactly right, which amounted to the same thing if you were trying to avoid a catastrophe.

"James, I don't think Victor meant—"

"Let him answer," Thorne said, not unkindly. It was worse that way. His civility had teeth.

Victor took a sip of water. Diana watched him swallow, watched the deliberation in his eyes. This was the moment where a person could pull back, where good sense might interrupt the instinct to chase the scent of something true. Victor had never been good at pulling back.

"I'm asking," Victor said, "whether the Hendricks account faced any complications during the consortium review. Whether there were timing issues or documentation gaps. Whether those were resolved before the audit was closed."

Marcus laughed. It was a real laugh, not the social lubricant kind. "Jesus. You're really doing this."

"Doing what?" Victor turned to him with the focus of a camera lens narrowing.

"Making an accusation and pretending it's journalism." Marcus set his napkin on the table. He was still smiling, but it had a different quality now—something almost delighted in its recklessness. "You don't have anything, Victor. You've got innuendo and a theory. You've got the kind of obsession that turns credible people into conspiracy theorists at parties."

Diana watched this exchange the way one watches a car approach a curve too fast. She could feel what was happening beneath the words—Marcus choosing to escalate rather than demur, the kind of choice that suggested he'd weighed the options and decided offense was better than defense. It was the choice of someone who'd already calculated that the damage might come regardless, so why not control the terms.

Elena's hand moved. Diana caught it—a small gesture, Elena reaching for her wine glass and then pulling back, as if even that small access to something steadying felt like it might give her away. Diana recognized the arithmetic in that restraint. She'd seen Elena do it before: the constant calculation of what a gesture might reveal, how a sip or a look could be misread or, worse, read exactly right.

Thorne set down his wine glass. "I think we should move forward with dinner. The lamb is getting cold."

But his tone suggested they wouldn't. His tone suggested they would sit here until something broke.

"The audit was clean," Marcus continued, addressing the table now, including everyone in his rebuttal. "The consortium brought in external auditors. No irregularities were found. It took time because that's how these things work—they're thorough. There were some document discrepancies early on, but nothing that stood up under actual scrutiny. This is exactly the kind of fishing expedition that destroys careers, Victor. You know that. You've written about it. And you're doing it anyway."

Diana heard the conviction in his voice and felt something cold move through her chest. Marcus believed what he was saying. Or had convinced himself he did. The distinction felt important and impossible.

Victor cut a piece of salmon. He worked at it methodically, waiting, letting the silence do its work. Diana recognized this too—the journalist's patience, the understanding that sometimes the person trying to fill quiet air was the one who said too much.

Lydia's fork was in her lap. Diana wasn't sure when it had fallen there. Lydia was looking at her plate as if the answer to a difficult question might be written in the arrangement of asparagus and potato.

"I have questions," Victor said finally. "That's what I do. I ask them. And I listen to the answers." He looked at Marcus directly. "I listen to how people answer. What they say and what they don't. What they emphasize and what they bury under layers of context."

"This is insane," Marcus said to Thorne. "Is this—are we seriously spending dinner while your journalist friend works through his hunches?"

Diana felt herself move. She didn't plan it. The motion was almost involuntary, her hand reaching for the water pitcher in the center of the table, an excuse, a gesture of normalcy, an attempt to physically interrupt the momentum of the conversation.

"More water?" she asked, directing the question to no one and everyone. "Elena?"

Elena's head turned. For a moment, Diana saw something fracture behind her eyes—a gratitude so fierce it bordered on panic. Elena nodded. Diana poured, watching the water fill the glass, focusing on that simple task like it was an act of salvation.

"You should ask Lydia," Marcus said.

The silence that followed was absolute.

Diana's hand, still holding the pitcher, went very still. She could feel the weight of it, the heaviness that suddenly seemed enormous. Across from her, Elena's entire body had contracted, like someone bracing for impact.

"Ask Lydia what?" Victor's voice had changed. It had sharpened into something predatory.

Lydia didn't move. Diana could see her hands pressed flat against the table, could see the way her knuckles had gone white. Thorne was watching Lydia now, his expression shifting into something more complex—curiosity layered with something darker.

Marcus was still smiling. "Lydia has been with Thorne longer than I have. She handles financial coordination on several accounts. If anyone would have noticed irregularities, it would have been her."

"I haven't noticed anything," Lydia said. Her voice was very small. She still wasn't looking up from her plate.

"See?" Marcus spread his hands. "Clean bill of health."

But Diana heard it—the flinch in Lydia's denial, the way the words had sounded like they were being read from a script. Diana felt the moment crystallize: Lydia knew something. Lydia had always known something. And now Marcus had just put her in the position of either confirming his version or admitting that her silence had been a choice, not an absence of knowledge.

Elena's jaw was clenched. Diana could see the muscle moving there, the effort of keeping herself still.

"Lydia," Victor said. He said it gently, which was almost worse. "What would you have noticed?"

Diana poured more water, even though no one had asked for it. She filled Elena's glass until it was nearly overflowing, watching the water climb toward the rim, unable to stop the gesture even as she recognized it for what it was: the physical manifestation of her inability to control anything about this moment.

* * *

Elena's glass trembled. Not visibly to anyone else, but Diana saw it—the slight ripple across the water's surface, the way Elena's fingers withdrew from the stem as though it had burned her. Diana set the pitcher down.

Victor's fork scraped his plate. He was still looking at Lydia, but his attention had shifted somehow, becoming more dangerous in its gentleness.

"What would you have noticed, Lydia?" His voice was almost conversational. "In your role. Over the months."

Lydia's throat worked. Her mouth opened. Closed.

Marcus laughed—a real laugh this time, not the sharp bark from before. "Christ, Victor. You're really doing this? You're going to sit here and interrogate my colleague like she's a witness in some true crime podcast?"

"She's not your colleague," Victor said, still to Lydia. "She reports to James."

Thorne's jaw tightened. His hand moved toward his wine glass, stopped. The gesture was territorial—a reminder of hierarchy, of who controlled what in this room. But there was something else in his face now. Curiosity. The darker kind.

Diana felt her sternum constrict. She could feel Elena beside her, barely breathing, the kind of breath control that comes from panic, from learning to disappear inside your own body.

"Lydia," Diana said. Her voice came out higher than she intended. "More wine?"

It was transparent. Absurd. Everyone at the table knew what she was doing. But Lydia seized on it anyway, her head jerking up toward the wine bottle on the sideboard, her chair scraping back.

"I should—"

"No," Victor said. Not harshly. Just factual. "Stay."

The word hung there. Stay. An instruction disguised as a request.

Marcus stood. He was smiling still, but his eyes had gone flat. "You know what? I'm going to say something, and then we're done with this. The audit was clean. Auditors signed off. There were minor discrepancies early on—timing issues, documentation gaps—which is normal in any merger transition. All resolved. All documented. If you have actual questions about that process, you ask through counsel. Not at my wife's dinner table."

He said "my wife" deliberately. Diana heard the ownership in it, the way he was reminding Victor—reminding all of them—of the lines that existed here, the social architecture that was supposed to keep certain things private.

Thorne was watching Lydia now with the intensity of a man who had just realized his trusted lieutenant knew something he didn't. His pride had shifted targets. It wasn't Victor's insinuations that bothered him anymore. It was the possibility that Lydia—loyal, quiet Lydia—had kept something from him.

Diana's hands were in her lap now. She was gripping her napkin so tightly her nails were leaving crescents in her palms. Elena's arm was touching hers. Not deliberately. Just the way bodies press together when they're trying not to fall.

Victor cut another piece of salmon. He chewed slowly, methodically, his eyes never leaving Lydia's face.

"Ask her what she noticed," he said to Thorne. "Not me. You."
