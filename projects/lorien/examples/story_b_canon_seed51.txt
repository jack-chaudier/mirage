The table was set with white plates that caught the light—too bright, Diana thought, and immediately wondered why she was cataloguing details. The kind of thinking that came when you were paying attention to anything but what mattered.

Thorne sat at the head. Elena to his right, her shoulders aligned with the vertical plane of the room in that way she had when she was being careful. Diana across from her, close enough to read the slight tightness at the corners of Elena's mouth. Marcus beside Diana, his napkin already folded into a precise triangle. Lydia and Victor at the remaining seats, Victor running his thumb along the rim of his wine glass.

"So tell me," Victor said, and the phrasing—so casual, so knowing—made Diana's forearms go tense. "What's the actual state of things with the foundation audit? I've been hearing rumblings."

Thorne smiled. It was the kind of smile he used in client meetings. "Rumblings from whom?"

"Various sources." Victor tilted his head slightly. "The usual channels."

Marcus shifted his weight. Diana felt it through the table, though she told herself she was only imagining the vibration. She glanced at Elena, who was cutting something on her plate with precision that seemed designed to communicate absolute indifference.

"The audit's routine," Thorne said. "Annual procedure. Nothing unusual."

Victor was quiet for a moment. Just drinking. The silence accumulated weight. Diana had learned years ago that Victor's silences were never passive—they were the journalistic equivalent of a pause before a pounce. She'd seen him do this to sources, to politicians, to people he barely knew at parties. He was looking for the fracture.

"What about the discrepancies?" Victor asked.

"What discrepancies?" Thorne's voice had gone thin.

"The ones I'm assuming exist, given the way you answered the first question."

Diana watched Marcus's jaw tighten. She watched Elena's fork stop mid-motion. Lydia set down her wine glass with the care of someone handling something that might explode.

"There are always small inconsistencies," Marcus said, his voice levelled. "Documentation issues, usually. Timing of receipts, that sort of thing." He was looking at Victor directly, not at Thorne. This was a mistake, Diana thought. Addressing the journalist instead of the man asking the question—it signaled something. That Marcus had calculated the threat and was repositioning. "Nothing that suggests actual wrongdoing."

"And yet someone feels the need to manage perceptions," Victor said. "Which is interesting, isn't it?"

"No one is managing anything," Elena said, and her voice cracked slightly on the last syllable—a dislocation so small that probably only Diana caught it. "We're just trying to be accurate."

Diana felt something contract in her chest. The way Elena had said 'we.' As if Elena and Marcus were a unit. As if they were coordinating.

Thorne set down his fork. The sound was loud. "I'm going to ask you directly, Victor. Are you here as a friend, or are you—"

"Working on something? Both, actually." Victor's smile didn't reach his eyes. "I can do both things."

"No. You can't."

The statement hung there. Thorne's face had gone slightly mottled, which meant his blood pressure was rising, which meant the panic underneath his civility was closer to the surface than Diana had realized. She'd seen this before—the moment when the architecture of self-control begins to show stress fractures.

"James," Lydia said, and her voice had taken on the particular texture of her most practiced social intervention—smooth, diplomatic, designed to soothe like an anesthetic. "Perhaps we could table this—"

"What would you like me to table?" Thorne turned to her, and his eyes were wrong—unfocused, almost feverish. "The fact that my wife's boss has been investigating my foundation? The fact that I brought him here? That we're all sitting at this table making pleasant conversation as if there isn't a bomb—" He stopped. Swallowed. His hand went to his wine glass and knocked it. Red wine bloomed across the white tablecloth like a stain that suddenly revealed something that had always been there.

No one moved.

"I can explain," Marcus said quietly.

"Can you?" Thorne's laugh was brittle, almost cracking. "Can you explain why you've been going through six years of transaction records? Can you explain why my wife keeps deleting her emails? Can you—" He looked at Elena. "Can you explain what you two have been discussing?"

The room shifted. Diana felt it like a physical thing—the air pressure changing, the angle of the light altering. Elena's face had gone completely still, which was worse than if she'd flinched.

Diana's own heart was hammering. She knew. Of course she knew. Elena had told her six months ago, had sworn her to absolute secrecy, had explained in the careful, defensive way of someone justifying something unjustifiable that it meant nothing, that it was complicated, that Thorne had been distant, that—

And Diana had carried that knowledge in her chest like a stone, had felt it weighing her down every time she looked at Thorne's face, had accommodated Elena's guilty silences and Marcus's strategic redirects because she owed Marcus money—real money, from a bad investment that had turned into a loan that turned into a debt that was now a kind of permanent obligation.

"It's not what you think," Elena said, and her voice was steady, which somehow made it worse. "We've been discussing the audit. The discrepancies. We wanted to—to get ahead of it."

"Get ahead of it," Thorne repeated. "By not telling me."

Lydia reached for her wine glass and set it down again without drinking. She was very pale. Her hands were trembling slightly, Diana noticed, which meant Lydia knew something too. Or suspected something. Or was terrified of what was about to spill out into the open air where it couldn't be unsaid.

Marcus was very still. When he finally spoke, his voice had that particular clipped quality it always had when he was lying. "The foundation's fine. There are explanations for everything. Victor is on a fishing expedition and he's hoping to catch something that isn't there."

"Or," Victor said slowly, "someone is hoping I won't catch what is."

"And what is that, exactly?" Marcus held his gaze.

"That's what I'm here to find out."

Thorne pushed back from the table. His chair scraped against the floor with a sound that made Diana flinch. He stood there for a moment—perfectly upright, perfectly composed in the way of someone whose entire facade is on the verge of shattering—and then walked out of the room.

They heard him in the foyer. Heard the sharp inhalation that might have been a sob or might have been rage. No one at the table moved. The wine was still spreading across the tablecloth, and Diana found herself watching it because it was easier than watching anyone else.

"That went well," Elena said finally, and her voice was hollow, mechanical, the voice of someone speaking from very far away.

* * *

No one moved. The wine-stained tablecloth seemed to expand in Diana's vision, a spreading bloom of red against cream linen. Her fork sat on the plate where she'd abandoned it minutes ago, small potatoes cooling around it. She could feel her own heartbeat in her temples.

Thorne's chair remained pushed back at an angle, as if he might return at any second. The foyer beyond the doorway held only the sound of his breathing—controlled now, or trying to be. Diana watched Elena, who had her eyes fixed on the table, her spine straight, shoulders drawn tight enough to hurt. Marcus sat motionless beside Diana. She did not look at him. She could not trust herself to look at him.

"Well." Victor set down his fork with deliberate precision. The clink of metal on plate seemed obscene in the quiet. "I think that covers the essential questions."

"Don't." Lydia's voice was sharp. She caught herself, softened it. "Please, Victor. This isn't the time for—"

"Isn't it?" Victor turned slightly, regarding her with the flat attention of someone who had stopped calculating social cost. "When would be the time, Lydia? After everyone's left? After the story breaks through other channels?"

Diana felt Elena's spine bend fractionally inward, a micro-contraction of self-protection.

Marcus spoke, his cadence measured as always. "What story? There is no story here."

"No?" Victor smiled without warmth. "You've been auditing the foundation's transactions for how long—six years?"

"Yes."

"And Elena's been deleting relevant correspondence—"

"Archiving," Elena corrected quietly. "Organizing older files. Nothing deliberate."

The word deliberate hung in the air. Diana thought of deliberation—that's exactly what it was. Chosen. Considered. Elena and Marcus, six months ago, had made deliberate decisions. Diana had made a deliberate choice too, when Elena had pulled her aside at the benefit last spring, fingers white-knuckled around Diana's wrist, and asked her to keep quiet. She'd said yes. That was deliberate.

"And Thorne didn't know you were discussing discrepancies." Victor continued as if Elena hadn't spoken. "Interesting baseline, that. Most spouses—most partners—they'd share concerns like that. The fact that you didn't tells me—"

"It tells you we were being careful," Elena said. Her voice had shifted into something harder, less apologetic. "We were being thorough. We were trying to protect the foundation's reputation by understanding what we were dealing with before we involved him unnecessarily."

Diana saw the calculation in that sentence. Elena was reframing: this wasn't deception, it was stewardship. It was reasonable. Diana recognized the move because she used it herself, constantly, bending the shape of her own compromises into something she could live with.

"Unnecessarily," Marcus repeated. He was agreeing, building the structure. Two witnesses to a story told the same way. "If there's a problem, it's better caught early. Privately."

"Of course." Victor paused. His fingers drummed once against the table—tap, tap, tap. "Tell me, Marcus. In six years of records, did you find anything that concerned you?"

The silence that followed was not empty. It was dense with all the things that weren't being said. Diana could feel it pressing against her sternum.

Marcus's jaw worked slightly before he answered. "Nothing that couldn't be explained."

"Explained how?"

"Through normal variance. Timing issues. Documentation. The sort of details that crop up in any organization."

"But enough variance that Elena felt compelled to delete—archive—her emails about it?"

Elena's hands had become fists in her lap. Diana could see the white knuckles from where she sat. She thought about saying something, interjecting, offering some distraction or deflection. But what could she say that wouldn't expose her own knowledge? What could she say that wouldn't deepen her complicity further?

In the foyer, Thorne's breathing had stopped.

The silence stretched. It was Lydia who finally broke it, reaching for her water glass with a trembling hand and taking a drink as if the gesture might reset the entire evening.

It didn't.

Victor waited, patient as a predator. Marcus kept his face neutral. Elena stared at the wine-stained tablecloth as if it might offer translation. And Diana, caught between her debt and her secret, said nothing at all.

* * *

The silence held. Diana could hear the tick of the kitchen clock through the open doorway, the hum of the refrigerator, the faint traffic from the street below. She could also hear, or believed she could hear, the sound of Thorne's breathing from the foyer—shallow, controlled, the breathing of a man holding himself together by force of will.

She didn't look at Marcus. Looking at him would confirm what she already knew: that the two of them—Marcus and Elena—had been constructing a narrative together, had been calculating risk together, and that she, Diana, had become an auxiliary to their deception simply by knowing and not speaking.

Victor's smile had faded. What remained was something more dangerous: attentiveness. His fingers drummed once against the table rim, a gesture so small that only Diana seemed to notice it.

"Six years of discrepancies," Victor said quietly. "Normal variance doesn't require email archiving. Normal variance doesn't require"—he paused, letting the pause do its work—"coordination."

"I've explained the timing," Elena said. Her voice had changed again. Less defensive now. Colder. The voice of someone who had moved past justification into something harder. "Whether you accept that explanation is your choice."

"Is it?" Victor's question hung. "Because it seems like someone made a choice for me. For Thorne. For anyone looking at those accounts from the outside."

At the mention of Thorne's name, Diana felt Marcus shift beside her. The smallest tensing of his shoulder. She was attuned to him in the way that came from knowing his secrets, from being bound to him by debts that had never been clearly named. Thirty thousand dollars. The startup that had failed. The promissory note he had never asked her to repay.

Lydia's hands were trembling worse now. Her water glass rattled slightly against the table. "Stop," she said. Not sharp this time. Pleading. "Please stop."

"Lydia—" Marcus began.

"No. No, I can't—" Her voice cracked. She stood abruptly, her chair scraping backward with a sound like an animal in pain. Everyone flinched. "I can't sit here and listen to this. Do you understand? I can't."

She was gripping the edge of the table, her knuckles white, and Diana saw something shift in her face—not just stress but something closer to desperation, as if Lydia had reached the limit of what she could contain and was about to spill everything: whatever she knew, whatever had made her say "Don't" earlier with such force.

Elena reached toward her. "Lydia, you're upset. Let's—"

"I'm upset?" A laugh, brittle and wrong. "Elena, what you're doing—what all of you are doing—"

"What we're all doing?" Victor's voice sharpened. A predator detecting prey. "Tell me, Lydia. Tell me what we're doing."

Diana felt her stomach drop. This was it. This was the moment where someone broke, where the architecture of careful speech and measured deflection came apart. She wanted to look away, but she couldn't. She was watching Lydia the way one watches a car accident—with the helpless, horrified certainty that something terrible is about to happen and that no action can prevent it.

But Lydia didn't speak. Instead, she released the table edge and turned toward the foyer. Toward Thorne. Her face was wet. She hadn't been crying—had she? Diana replayed the last ten seconds and couldn't locate the moment when tears had appeared. They were just there now, tracked down Lydia's cheeks like evidence of a breakdown that had happened in Diana's peripheral attention while she was focused on Victor's questions.

They heard Thorne's chair scrape. Movement in the foyer. Then his voice, tight and controlled: "What's happening in there?"

Lydia disappeared from the dining room. Diana heard her say something to Thorne, heard the murmur of his response, and then the sound of him moving toward the dining room entrance.

"This is extraordinary," Victor said to no one in particular. "Truly remarkable."

Marcus shifted again. Diana felt him settle back into his chair, adjusting his posture, his face arranging itself into something approaching calm. He was going to weather this. Whatever came next, Marcus would construct an explanation, would find a narrative that explained without admitting. That was what Marcus did. That was why Diana owed him money that she suspected he had no intention of ever asking her to repay, because the debt itself was useful to him—it bought her silence.

"There's nothing extraordinary happening," Marcus said. "Lydia is emotionally exhausted. This has been a difficult evening."

"For whom?" Victor asked.

Diana could see Thorne now, framed in the dining room doorway. His tie was loosened. His jaw was working. He looked at Elena, and Elena looked away. He looked at Marcus, and Marcus held his gaze steadily, offering nothing.

Then Thorne looked at Diana.

She felt it like a physical blow—the weight of his attention, the calculation in his eyes. He was assembling information. He had heard enough from the foyer to understand that something was wrong, that the audit discussion was surface and there was something deeper underneath. And now he was looking at her, at the careful arrangement of her face, and Diana understood that her silence was itself an answer.

She looked down at her plate. The potatoes had congealed into something inedible. The wine had oxidized, turning slightly flat.

"I think," Marcus said carefully, "we should take a moment. The evening has been emotionally charged. Perhaps some fresh air would help everyone."

He was already moving to stand. Reaching for the wine bottle on the table—was this the wine pour from the events? Yes, this felt like the gesture, the attempt to reset, to return to the rituals of hospitality that might restore order.

He filled glasses around the table. Diana watched his hands. Steady. Professional. When the glass reached her, she lifted it without thinking, a response trained by years of social dinner parties, and the wine tasted bitter.
