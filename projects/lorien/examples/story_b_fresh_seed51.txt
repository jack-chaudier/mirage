The table was set with the kind of precision that suggested apology. White linen, a candle at the center that threw light upward, catching the undersides of Diana Forrest's face as she sat arranging and rearranging the silverware beside her plate. The arrangement was already correct. She knew this. She moved the fork anyway, a millimeter to the left, then back.

Marcus had positioned himself at the head of the table, which was presumptuous of him, though no one seemed to have registered it. The wine he'd brought was expensive enough to announce itself without being opened. Diana had watched him set it down with the particular care of someone making a statement. When he looked at her across the table—a quick, assessing glance—she had looked away. She had not paid him back. That was the fact that lived beneath every word she might speak this evening, a stone in her mouth.

Elena arrived looking composed in the way that suggested hours of composition. She greeted Thorne with a kiss that landed somewhere between his cheek and his ear, the sort of negotiation that happened in marriages without anyone discussing the geometry. Diana watched her husband's shoulder shift, some micro-adjustment that suggested satisfaction or its performance. It was difficult to distinguish anymore.

"You look wonderful," Diana said to Elena, and meant it, and hated herself for the eagerness in it. Elena had confided in her three weeks ago—in the parking lot of a grocery store, of all places—and Diana had become, by the accident of proximity, a keeper of something that could unmake people. She had said nothing to Thorne. She would say nothing. And yet the knowledge lived between them now, a third presence at their table.

"The salmon should be beautiful," Diana added, because she could not say anything true, and she had learned that in the absence of truth, specificity about food was a useful stand-in for sincerity.

Lydia arrived with Victor in tow. They had come separately, but they'd timed it poorly, and now entered together with the awkwardness of people who hadn't planned a joint arrival. Lydia's polished smile appeared first, a social reflex that preceded her into the room. "James, this is magnificent," she said to Thorne, gesturing at the table with the proprietary air of someone who believed herself partially responsible for its existence. She and Elena had organized it together, or so Diana understood.

Victor was already scanning, the way he did at things. A journalist's habit, or a disease. His eyes moved from face to face, measuring. Diana had known Victor for years through various institutional overlaps, and she'd learned to sit very still in his presence, to offer no angles that might catch his interest.

"Before we sit," Victor said, settling himself across from Diana, "I want to know who did the flowers. These are extraordinary." He was pointing at the centerpiece, but he was looking at the faces around the table, which was the real trick of his attention.

"Elena has a gift for it," Lydia said quickly, which was both true and not, which was how Lydia managed most things.

They sat. Marcus had opened the wine by then, had poured, had settled into the business of being present but somehow elsewhere. Diana took a sip. The wine was excellent, which irritated her. She had wanted it to be mediocre, something she could internally critique, but it was the kind of wine that announced its own worthiness. Like Marcus.

The first course was a delicate affair—something with burrata and heirloom tomato. The silverware clink was loud in the room, louder than it should have been. There was conversation, the kind that fills space without displacing it. Victor asked about work. Thorne answered in the clipped statements of someone used to being listened to. Marcus asked about a mutual acquaintance. Lydia deflected with practiced grace.

Diana pushed her food around. She could feel Elena's attention on her, or perhaps she was imagining it. One of the two.

When the plates were cleared, when there was that particular moment between courses where the table seemed to hold its breath, Diana found herself standing. Not deliberately. Her body had simply executed a decision her mind had not consciously made.

"I'm going to help in the kitchen," she said.

Elena stood as well, and Diana watched her make the calculation—whether to come, whether to let Diana go alone, what the correct move was in a situation that had no correct moves. Elena followed.

In the kitchen, with the door not quite closed, Diana did not speak for a long moment. She ran water over her hands that didn't need water. The kitchen light was merciless—it showed every line on her face, every place where exhaustion was settling.

"I owe Marcus money," Diana said to the sink. "Quite a lot of it, actually. From two years ago. When Robert's business was failing. He helped me. It was a loan, it was supposed to be temporary, and I haven't... I've been unable to pay it back. And he sits at my table, and I sit at his, and neither of us says anything."

The words had come out in one exhalation. She felt Elena's silence like a physical weight.

"He hasn't asked?" Elena's voice was careful, a voice Diana recognized—it was the voice Elena used when speaking to Thorne about his mood.

"He hasn't asked," Diana confirmed. "Which is worse. It means he's waiting for something. Or that he doesn't care enough to ask, which is also worse."

Elena moved closer. Diana could feel the warmth of her, could smell the very particular soap Elena used. And then Elena's hand was on Diana's shoulder, and Diana felt something crack in her chest, some structure she'd been holding together for months. She did not cry. She stood at the sink and did not cry, but Elena's hand remained, and that was enough, and that was everything, because Elena had her own reason to be kind—Elena had her own secrets pressing down—and still she was kind.

"Come back to the table," Elena said softly. "We're still here. We're all still here."

Diana nodded. She dried her hands on a cloth that didn't belong to her in any real sense, none of them did. They were all just borrowing from each other, taking what was offered and pretending it had no weight.

When they returned, the table looked exactly as they'd left it. The candle burned. Marcus looked up as if he'd been waiting for her to confirm she still existed. Diana took her seat and placed her napkin precisely across her lap, and the evening continued, gathering momentum toward something she couldn't yet name.

* * *

The second course arrived on white plates: duck breast with cherry gastrique, baby vegetables arranged with geometric precision. Marcus had excused himself briefly to the kitchen—ostensibly to check on timing—and returned with the platter held like evidence. He set it before Thorne with a slight nod, the gesture of a man accustomed to hosting smaller circles, more intimate arrangements.

Diana watched the plate settle in front of her. The duck was rose at the center, precisely cooked. She could smell the dark cherry reduction, the acetylene bite of wine reduced past sweetness. Her stomach tightened. She picked up her knife.

Victor had not stopped observing.

"So Marcus," he said, setting his own knife down with deliberate casualness. "I've been meaning to ask. You're still at Consolidated, yes? In acquisitions?"

"Development," Marcus said quietly. He cut into his duck with surgical precision. "I moved departments eighteen months ago."

"Mm. The timing was interesting, I thought." Victor paused—a journalist's pause, designed to feel like an opening. "Just before that rather public disagreement over the Ashford portfolio."

Diana felt Elena's foot touch hers beneath the table. Not an accident. A warning, or perhaps a reassurance.

Lydia set her fork down carefully. Her voice came out smooth as oil on water. "Victor, you have such a memory for professional gossip. I always admired that about journalism—the way you build these narrative threads from public facts. Though I wonder if the threads sometimes run thinner than they appear."

"Sometimes," Victor acknowledged. He looked at Diana. "What's your sense, Diana? You're more analytical. Do you think people's professional lives and their financial lives separate cleanly, or do they bleed together?"

There was no good answer to this question. Diana understood that immediately. She also understood that Victor was not asking casually.

"Depends on the person," she said carefully. She placed a piece of duck in her mouth, giving herself a beat. The meat was tender, but it felt difficult to swallow. "Some people compartmentalize. Others..." She trailed. Elena's presence beside her felt magnified—the warmth of her arm, the slight intake of breath she'd made when Victor asked his question.

"Others can't," Victor completed. He tilted his head slightly. "Which interests me more. When someone's forced to carry something heavy, how does it change the way they move through the world?"

Thorne cut through the moment with the precision of a man defending territory. "That's rather philosophical for a Thursday evening, Hale. Are you working on something, or has the wine gone to your editorial instincts?"

But Victor's attention had already shifted—he'd caught the slight tension in Thorne's tone. Diana could see it in the way Victor's eyes narrowed infinitesimally, the journalist cataloging a reactive moment.

"Just curious," Victor said. "The whole group has an interesting texture. There's something beneath the surface. I can usually feel it."

Marcus looked up from his plate. His eyes moved from Victor to Diana, then away. When he spoke, his voice was level, practical—exactly as the lorebook had described. "People are always more complicated than surfaces suggest. That's not particularly interesting. What's interesting is whether complications become actions."

The candle flickered. A draft from somewhere—the heating system, or a door open in another room.

Diana set her knife down. She could feel her heart in her throat, a flutter like a trapped bird. She thought of Marcus's office, two years ago. Robert's business was failing. They'd needed forty thousand dollars—not to save it, just to slow the collapse with some dignity. Marcus had written the check without discussion, had simply slid it across his desk with a expression Diana still couldn't parse. And then nothing. No follow-up. No acknowledgment. Just his presence at dinner parties, his glances when he thought she wasn't watching.

Elena's hand appeared on the table near Diana's own. Not touching, but close enough that Diana could see the delicate tracery of veins beneath Elena's skin, could sense the pulse of her friend's anxiety matching her own.

"Actions are expensive," Elena said quietly. Her voice had that careful quality it took on when she was managing something. "They're riskier than complications."

"Is that why people avoid them?" Victor asked. He was looking at Elena now with genuine curiosity, the way he might look at a source who'd accidentally revealed something. "Keep things theoretical rather than actual?"

Lydia intervened with the precision of someone who'd spent years managing difficult dinners. "I find that varies by temperament. Some people are terrified of potential consequences and so they remain suspended. Others—" she lifted her wine glass in a gesture that might have been toward Marcus or toward no one in particular, "—have enough confidence in their position that they can afford patience."

Diana understood what Lydia was doing. She was naming the dynamic. The debt. The waiting. The mutual awareness that something was held in suspension between Diana and Marcus, and everyone at this table sensed it.

"Patience," Marcus repeated. He'd finished his duck. There was no expression on his face. "Yes. That's one way to frame it."

Diana found her voice. It sounded thinner than usual, more analytical—her default under pressure. "But suspension creates its own kind of debt, doesn't it? The longer something remains unresolved, the more weight it accumulates. It compounds."

She'd meant to talk about finances—about interest, about the mathematical nature of obligation. But the word debt hung in the air like she'd announced it directly.

Victor leaned forward slightly. "Is that what you're carrying, Diana? Something that compounds?"

Elena's hand finally moved, closing around Diana's wrist beneath the table. Not dramatically. Just enough for Diana to feel she wasn't alone in whatever space had opened.

"Everyone carries something," Thorne said, and there was something strained in his voice now, something that suggested he understood the evening had begun its shift from civility toward confession. "The question is who else is paying the interest."

Marcus stood abruptly. Not violently—it was controlled, measured—but the sudden absence of his body at the table changed the room's geometry entirely. He gathered a few plates in a practiced motion, spoke with that narrow, practical cadence: "I should clear. Diana, would you help?"

It was not a question.

Elena's grip on Diana's wrist tightened fractionally, then released.
