\f1\b\fs48 \cf2 \strokec2 Goal Evolution in Deterministic Narrative Simulation: Restoring Structural Quality Through Coordinated Agent Adaptation\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa160\partightenfactor0

\fs36 \cf2 Abstract\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 Current approaches to generative narrative rely primarily on Large Language Models (LLMs) executing sequential token prediction, resulting in stories that are locally coherent but often globally episodic. We introduce 
\f2\i Lorien
\f0\i0 , a simulation-first narrative engine that inverts this paradigm by decoupling structural generation from prose rendering. Lorien utilizes a deterministic, utility-weighted multi-agent simulation to generate event sequences, which are then evaluated by a grammar-constrained search to extract mathematically valid dramatic arcs. While this architecture achieves a 98% structural validity baseline in isolated scenarios, sequentially chaining simulations with persistent world states (canon) results in monotonic structural degradation (~0.015 mean arc score decay per episode). Through zero-cost computational ablation studies, we diagnose this decay as 
\f2\i epistemic ossification
\f0\i0 \'97a state of information equilibrium where agents continue to execute obsolete objective functions after core secrets are universally revealed. We demonstrate that while forcing unilateral belief mutation cannot rescue structural tension, coordinated 
\f2\i Goal Evolution
\f0\i0 \'97updating agent utility vectors to align with the new epistemology\'97restores structural quality to within 0.006 of pristine baseline levels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that uncoordinated (asymmetrical) agent evolution actively breaks the structural validity of unaligned agents, proving the network dependency of dramatic structure. Finally, we propose a discretized "Stance Matrix" to operationalize procedural objective-function adaptation while protecting the mathematical integrity of the simulation from stochastic LLM generation.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf2 \strokec2 1. Introduction: The Crystallization Paradigm\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 The prevailing method for generating computational narrative utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to autoregressively predict the next most likely token. While this produces excellent prose texture and local logical consistency, it fundamentally struggles with global structural relationships. Deep fiction relies on "cathedral" architecture: promises seeded early and resolved late, dramatic irony driven by persistent information asymmetry, and climaxes forced by intersecting, mutually exclusive character constraints. Sequential token generation produces an "episodic" architecture where events happen 
\f2\i after
\f0\i0  one another, rather than 
\f2\i because
\f0\i0  of one another.\
We present an alternative generative paradigm called 
\f2\i crystallization
\f0\i0 , instantiated in the Lorien narrative engine. Lorien treats structural narrative generation as a deterministic constraint-satisfaction problem, entirely independent of LLM text generation. In this paradigm, global coherence emerges from mathematical constraint resolution rather than local linguistic prediction.\
However, attempting to chain these discrete simulations into serialized structures (e.g., a continuous "season" of episodes sharing a continuous canon) reveals a fundamental boundary in simulation-based storytelling: as agents interact, information is universally distributed. Secrets are revealed, tension potential is spent, and the simulation suffers from monotonic structural degradation. This paper investigates the underlying computational mechanics of this degradation and proves that coordinated agent goal-evolution is required to maintain structural validity in persistent computational narratives.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf2 2. System Architecture and Baseline Stability\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa160\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 The Lorien engine operates via a strict separation of concerns, executing in four discrete phases:\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\sa160\partightenfactor0

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Simulation Layer:
\f0\b0  A pure Python, deterministic multi-agent simulation. Given a starting seed and a \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 WorldCanon\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2  (inherited world state), $N$ agents driven by numeric utility vectors (\cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 goals\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 , \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 relationships\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 , \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 commitments\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 ) interact across discrete locations. A standard run produces ~200 discrete events (e.g., \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 CHAT\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 , \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 REVEAL\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 , \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 CONFLICT\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 , \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 CATASTROPHE\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 ).\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Metrics Layer:
\f0\b0  A mathematical evaluation of the event sequence calculating 
\f2\i Tension
\f0\i0  (accumulated conflict pressure) and 
\f2\i Dramatic Irony
\f0\i0  (the topological gap between an agent's internal \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 claim_states\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2  and the established objective truth).\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Extraction Layer (Rashomon):
\f0\b0  A grammar-constrained search algorithm that parses the event sequence for a structurally valid protagonist arc. The grammar enforces strict beat topologies: 
\f2\i Setup
\f0\i0  must precede 
\f2\i Complication
\f0\i0 ; 
\f2\i Escalation
\f0\i0  must precede a singular 
\f2\i Turning Point
\f0\i0 , followed by 
\f2\i Consequence
\f0\i0 . The system utilizes "Rashomon Extraction" to extract up to six concurrent, genuinely distinct protagonist arcs from the exact same objective event sequence.\

\f0\b0  An LLM acts solely as a rendering engine to translate the mathematically validated arcs into prose.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 Baseline Validation:
\f0\b0  In a 50-seed parameter sweep of a highly constrained 6-agent "Dinner Party" scenario (involving concealed infidelity and financial fraud), the Rashomon extractor produced valid arcs in 294/300 cases (98%), yielding a mean valid arc score of 0.694. This establishes that the beat grammar robustly captures universal topologies of dramatic structure.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf2 3. The Autopsy of Narrative Heat Death\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 To achieve episodic chaining (Story A $\\rightarrow$ B $\\rightarrow$ C $\\rightarrow$ D $\\rightarrow$ E), Lorien persists a \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 WorldCanon\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2  object between simulation runs, transferring accumulated physical "texture" facts and simulation state (location tension residue, agent belief states).\
While LLM-generated texture facts accumulated healthily (0 $\\rightarrow$ 69 facts across 5 steps), empirical testing proved them structurally inert. Inherited simulation state, however, resulted in a strict monotonic degradation of the mean valid arc score. A 4-chain seed-order experiment isolated the variable, revealing a decay rate of ~0.015 per chain step: Depth 0 (Score: 0.696) degraded to Depth 4 (Score: 0.637). Attempts to cure this via mathematical float decay (reducing starting tension residue) produced zero structural effect.\
We diagnosed this state-space collapse as 
\f1\b Epistemic Ossification
\f0\b0  (Information Equilibrium). Lorien\'92s tension math leverages information asymmetry. By Depth 2 of the simulation chain, major secrets (e.g., the illicit affair, an ongoing investigation) transitioned from \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 unknown\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2  to \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 believes_true\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2  for all 6 agents. The potential energy of the system reached zero, yet agents continued attempting to execute their original, obsolete utility functions (e.g., the guilty party's goal vector still heavily weighted \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 secrecy\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 ). The engine accurately modeled the resulting structural incoherence, producing low-scoring, repetitive interactions.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf2 4. Experiment 1: The Causal Interface (Belief Perturbation)\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 To prove that categorical \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 claim_states\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2  are the causal interface governing the simulation's structure, and to test if injecting new information asymmetry could rescue the score, we conducted a zero-cost, headless perturbation experiment at Depth 2.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 Methodology:
\f0\b0  We intercepted the exhausted \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 WorldCanon\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2  before Story C (Baseline Score: 0.668). We manually mutated a single categorical belief: shifting the protagonist's (Thorne's) knowledge of a peripheral secret (\cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 secret_embezzle_01\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 ) from \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 unknown\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2  to \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 suspects\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 , effectively simulating a sudden realization.\

\f0\b0  System trace logs recorded 13,895 discrete reads of \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 claim_states\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2  during the tick loop, confirming it as the primary causal interface. The perturbation caused event divergence at tick 0, proving instantaneous deterministic sensitivity. A control mutation of a structurally inert belief produced zero divergence.\

\f1\b \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 {\listtext	2	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Score Penalty:
\f0\b0  Despite the sensitivity, the global mean arc score actively dropped from the baseline 0.668 to 0.628 ($\\Delta$ -0.040). Thorne's personal arc dropped precipitously from 0.709 to 0.550.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 Discussion:
\f0\b0  The mathematical extraction grammar correctly penalized the perturbation. Thorne's core utility objective was defined as 
\f2\i "Maintain normalcy."
\f0\i0  Forcing an agent whose primary reality (his marriage) had just been publicly destroyed to abruptly investigate a peripheral white-collar crime was recognized as structurally incoherent\'97forensic noise rather than valid dramatic escalation. Adding a peripheral mystery cannot fix an exhausted narrative ecosystem if the core agent objectives remain mismatched with the emotional reality of the world state.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf2 5. Experiment 2: Coordinated Goal Evolution\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 Following the failure of belief perturbation, we hypothesized that structural validity could be restored by 
\f1\b Goal Evolution
\f0\b0 : updating the agents' underlying objective functions to align with the new, post-revelation epistemology.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 Methodology:
\f0\b0  Using the identical, exhausted Depth 2 canon, we intercepted the simulation instantiation. Rather than mutating belief states, we mutated the target weights and core goals of the agents (e.g., shifting the guilty party from 
\f2\i Concealment
\f0\i0  to 
\f2\i Survival
\f0\i0 ; shifting the betrayed from 
\f2\i Maintain Normalcy
\f0\i0  to 
\f2\i Vengeance
\f0\i0 ). We evaluated three conditions against the baseline: 
\f2\i Targeted Evolution
\f0\i0  (2 agents), 
\f2\i Full Evolution
\f0\i0  (all 6 agents), and 
\f2\i Asymmetrical Evolution
\f0\i0  (Thorne only).\

\f1\b Results:
\f0\b0 \
| Condition | Mean Arc Score | $\\Delta$ vs. Baseline | Valid Arcs (out of 6) |\
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\
| Depth 0 (Fresh baseline) | 0.721 | +0.053 | 6 |\
| Baseline (Depth 2 exhausted) | 0.668 | -- | 6 |\
| Targeted Evolution (2 agents) | 0.683 | +0.015 | 6 |\
| 
\f1\b Full Evolution (6 agents)
\f0\b0  | 
\f1\b 0.715
\f0\b0  | 
\f1\b +0.047
\f0\b0  | 
\f1\b 6
\f0\b0  |\
| Asymmetrical (Thorne only) | 0.641 | -0.027 |

\f1\b Finding 1: System Recovery
\f0\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f2\i \cf2 Full Evolution
\f0\i0  completely cured the monotonic degradation, resulting in a mean valid arc score of 0.715. This represents an improvement of +0.047 over the baseline, placing it within -0.006 of the pristine Depth 0 score. The previously guilty agent (Elena), whose obsolete "concealment" objective had anchored her baseline score at a dismal 0.468, experienced a massive recovery to 
\f1\b 0.725
\f0\b0 , proving that "bad arcs" in deterministic systems are often accurate representations of defunct utility vectors.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 Finding 2: The Network Dependency of Drama
\f0\b0 \
The 
\f2\i Asymmetrical
\f0\i0  (Thorne-only) condition yielded a critical negative result. Evolving a single agent degraded the mean score to 0.641. More significantly, an unaligned secondary agent (Marcus) failed to produce a valid arc entirely (\cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 valid_arcs\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 : 5/6, Marcus score: \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 null\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 ). Evolving the protagonist into an aggressive investigator while leaving his primary antagonist running an obsolete stealth subroutine fractured the ecosystem. The beat grammar acted as a falsification engine, correctly recognizing that this unaligned interaction possessed no valid dramatic topology. This proves that a protagonist cannot maintain a valid structural arc unless the surrounding multi-agent ecosystem adapts to provide coherent resistance.\

\f1\b Finding 3: Emergent Genre Shift
\f0\b0 \
Without altering the hardcoded event-generation rules, updating the utility weights triggered a native shift in the simulation's event distribution. Comparing the Baseline to the Full Evolution condition, information-gathering events plummeted (\cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 CHAT\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 : 24 $\\rightarrow$ 13, \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 REVEAL\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 : 2 $\\rightarrow$ 0), while kinetic confrontation spiked (\cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 CONFLICT\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 : 7 $\\rightarrow$ 13, \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 CATASTROPHE\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 : 2 $\\rightarrow$ 7). The system natively transitioned from extracting tension via 
\f2\i Information Asymmetry
\f0\i0  to extracting tension via 
\f2\i Kinetic Conflict
\f0\i0 , which the extraction grammar correctly recognized and rewarded.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf2 6. Discussion and Future Work: The Stance Matrix\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 These findings demonstrate that coordinated goal evolution produces super-linear structural improvement in utility-weighted narrative ecologies. To achieve long-form season orchestration, a computational narrative system must adapt character parameters to shifting epistemologies.\
However, utilizing an LLM to dynamically generate these new numeric utility vectors (float values) on the fly introduces stochastic hallucination, destroying the determinism and balanced utility economy of the simulation layer.\
We propose 
\f1\b The Stance Matrix
\f0\b0 : a discrete state-machine architecture. Successful parameter evolutions (as discovered in Experiment 2) will be formalized as immutable, pre-balanced Python dictionaries (e.g., \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 Stances.THE_CONCEALER\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2  vs. \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 Stances.THE_SURVIVOR\cf2 \cb1 \strokec2 ). In future iterations, the LLM will serve strictly as a semantic classifier. Operating between episodes, it will analyze accumulated "Canon Texture" (somatic and atmospheric details) and output a single categorical key to trigger the deterministic application of the next Stance. This bridges the semantic intuition of Large Language Models with the rigorous mathematical constraint-satisfaction required for deep narrative structure.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa160\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs36 \cf2 7. Conclusion\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 Monotonic structural degradation in chained generative narratives is not a computational error, but the mathematical measurement of agents refusing to adapt to reality. By proving that deterministic multi-agent simulations are strictly dependent on coordinated goal-ecology, we demonstrate that persistent digital storytelling requires dynamic adaptation. Through coordinated goal evolution, the Lorien engine proves capable of sustaining mathematically rigorous, highly valid dramatic structures across persistent state changes. These findings validate the crystallization paradigm and establish that formal mathematical modeling of shifting multi-agent constraints\'97facilitated by discrete state transitions\'97is a prerequisite for generating coherent, infinite-horizon computational fiction.\
