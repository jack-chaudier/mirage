# RHUN Experiment Views

This directory provides non-destructive, topic-based views over experiment runners.

- `streaming/` -> Exps 40-49 and policy/diagnostic streaming runs
- `theorem/` -> boundary, invariance, and theorem-focused runs
- `diagnostics/` -> failure taxonomy and algorithm diagnostic runs

All files are symlinks to runners in `../`.
